== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Getting Started =


1. **Forum Page:** wpForo creates a page with `/community/` slug. If this slug is used you'll have `/community-2/` or `/community-3/` slug. You can find the correct one in Forums > Settings > General Tab. Make sure you use WordPress permalinks. wpForo doesn't work with default `?p=1` URL structure.
