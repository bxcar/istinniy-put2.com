== Description ==

Karma is a responsive music player plugin for WordPress with which you could insert multiple players in your website.

Some of Karma's features:

* The active player will stop if you play another Karma's player.
* Visual Composer compatibility.
* RTL compatibility.
* Seekbar mobile friendly.
* Autoplay and loop.
* Responsive.

Usage:

You can use the following shortcode to insert the player anywhere in your theme.
[karma_by_kadar__simple_player title="Louis Armstrong - Hello Dolly" volume="0.7" loop="false" autoplay="false" rtl="false" vc_src="URL"]

If the value of the parameter is "false" you can delete the parameter. The same case is for "volume" parameter too, if you want to be 0.7 you coud delete the parameter because by default is 0.7 and it doesn't require to rewrite the value of the parameter. The previous example could be written as:
[karma_by_kadar__simple_player title="Louis Armstrong - Hello Dolly" vc_src="URL"]
